The trait contains a class for implicit conversion from LibGDX Array ti a class supporting scala functional programming (map, flatMap, filter...)\r\n* A definition of A* path-finding algorithm and a simple implementation for 2D games\r\n* A graphic resources loader which support reloading on the fly\r\n* A Shader memory helper to easily activate/disabled shaders\r\n* An extension of TileMapRenderer to enabled fake perspective in 2D games\r\n* An action holder trait with several implementation to manage input action from keyboard or from UI\r\n* An object pool trait and some implementation for most used libgdx class (Vector2, Rectangle...)\r\n* Some missing math, gfx, polygons utilities\r\n\r\n## Build framework and deploy on local repository\r\nTo build the framework, just run gradle task:\r\n```\r\ngradlew clean build\r\n```\r\n\r\nto publish on a local Maven repository, run:\r\n```\r\ngradlew publishToMavenLocal\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThe framework is based on The [MIT License (MIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\r\nThe framework was created by [Olivier MARTIN](http://gameover.co.in) <pixelduck.game@gmail.com>.\r\nAuthors and contributors are listed in file [contributors.txt](contributors.txt) in the root of the project.\r\nFeel free to submit your Pull Request!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
